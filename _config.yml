about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am detail-oriented person with the ability to look into the bigger picture of the problems that I am tackling.
  My passion is to take the mathematical and machine learning models, combine it with the data, computation power, and intuition, and deploy it in improving the practical
  processes with the aim of building autonomous decisions making systems.

          Our algorithm, Block Evolutionary Training (BET), reaches higher rewards than Reinforcement Learning methods on PyBullet physics engine simulater.    
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Evolutionary methods have been shown to be a competitive alternative to DRL methods in solving sequential decision-making problems.
          [Salimans, et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864) show that a simple variant of the Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) can achieve similar performance
          to the Deep Reinforcement Learning methods on Atari and Mujoco environments. We show that by integrating the structure of the neural policy network into Evolution Strategies 
          one can achive higher rewards on continuous control tasks such as PyBullet environment.

          We show that Evolution Strategies can learn neural policy networks for managing inventory in different inventory management problems.  
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Recently it has been shown that Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can learn to manage inventory in inventory management problems.
          However, RL methods require [significant hyper-parameter optimization](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3302881). 
          We show that Evolution Strategies can learn neural policy networks for managing inventory in different inventory management problems 
          with an order of magnitude smaller neural networks and without need for hyper-parameter optimization.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
